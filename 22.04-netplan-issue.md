# Ubuntu 22.04 Netplan Configuration Guide

This guide helps you disable cloud-init's network management on Ubuntu 22.04 to resolve netplan issues.

## Problem
Cloud-init may interfere with netplan network configuration on Ubuntu 22.04, causing network management conflicts.

## Solution

### Step 1: Create Configuration File
Create a new configuration file to disable cloud-init's network management:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg
```

### Step 2: Add Configuration Content
Add the following content to the file:

```yaml
network: {config: disabled}
```

### Step 3: Save and Exit
- Press `Ctrl + X` to exit nano
- Press `Y` to confirm saving
- Press `Enter` to confirm the filename

### Step 4: Apply Network Configuration
Apply the netplan configuration to activate your changes:

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

## What This Does
- **Disables cloud-init network management**: Prevents cloud-init from overriding your manual network configuration
- **Enables full netplan control**: Allows netplan to manage network settings without interference
- **Resolves configuration conflicts**: Eliminates competing network management systems

## Verification
After completing these steps, your network configuration should be managed entirely by netplan, resolving any conflicts with cloud-init.
